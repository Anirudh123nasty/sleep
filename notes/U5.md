# Unit 5 Notes

## 5.1

* Computing innovations are created by people

* Methods change with time, and new computing innovations are created

* Some innovations happen randomly and unexpectedly

* Effects can be +/- to different people

* Advancements in computing have lead to creativity in other fields (medicine, engineering, communications, and arts)

* Computing innovations can work in ways unintended by the creators

  * It is not possible for a programmer to prepare for all the ways a computing innovation is used

* Rapid sharing of a program can result in unintended uses of a program

  

## 5.2

* **Digital Divide** - differing access to computing devices & the Internet
  * Several issues that arise
* Internet access varies b/w socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics
* Raises equity issues both globally & locally
* Affected by the actions from individuals, orgs, and gov'ts



## 5.3

* Computing Innovations contain bias
  * Bias is written into algorithms, or bias can be in the data used
  * Programmers should do their best to reduce bias in their programs
  * Combatting human bias that is embedded at all levels of software development



## 5.4

* People participate in problem-solving processes on several scales
* Widespread access to info facilitates identification of solutions, dev. of solutions, and dissemination of results
* Science has been distributed in similar ways
* **Crowdsourcing** - the practice of obtaining input/info from a large # of people on the internet
  * Human capabilities are enhanced by collaboration via computing
  * Offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes (GoFundMe)



## 5.5

* Use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns
* Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of that creator
* Must cite authors in program to provide credit
* **Creative Commons** - A public copyright license that enables the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work



## 5.6

* Several privacy risks from collecting and storing personal data
* **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** - Info on an individual that identifies, links, relates, or describes them
* Search Engines can record and maintain history of users
* Websites record even more information
* PII can be used in malicious ways, safe computing ensures this does not happen
